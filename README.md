We are using data from two R packages:

- **available** [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available/index.html): This package let us "Check if the Title of a Package is Available, Appropriate and Interesting".
- **pkgsearch** [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pkgsearch/index.html): This package helped us "Search CRAN metadata about packages by keyword, popularity, recent activity, package name and more. Uses the 'R-hub' search server, see <https://r-pkg.org> and the CRAN metadata database, that contains information about CRAN packages."
