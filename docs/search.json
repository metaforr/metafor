    "text": "1 Introduction\nR is fun. Why?\nR is considered fun primarily due to its community and extensive package ecosystem. The active and supportive community fosters a very collaborative environment, making learning enjoyable. The wealth of packages available in R facilitates efficient data analysis, visualization, and modeling, enabling users to tackle complex tasks with ease. Moreover, the language’s flexibility encourages creativity and customization, allowing users to create tailored solutions. Its intuitive syntax and widespread use across academia and various industries further contribute to its appeal, making the journey of learning and using R an engaging and rewarding experience.\nPython might let you fly, but R will make your data dance the tango.\nCode\nlibrary(\"cowsay\")\nsay(\"when in doubt, puRRR it out!\", \"cat\")\n\n\n\n -------------- \nwhen in doubt, puRRR it out! \n --------------\n    \\\n      \\\n        \\\n            |\\___/|\n          ==) ^Y^ (==\n            \\  ^  /\n             )=*=(\n            /     \\\n            |     |\n           /| | | |\\\n           \\| | |_|/\\\n      jgs  //_// ___/\n               \\_)\nLike the cat said, the innate advantage with R is how quickly we can visualize ideas.\n[BUT]\nFinding a good R library is demanding. ggplot2 is might not be the answer for everything. So, we have tasked ourselves to use statistical methods to explore and visualize entirety of CRAN packages using what we learnt from STATGR5702 at Columbia University."

Uses the ‘R-hub’ search server, see https://r-pkg.org and the CRAN metadata database, that contains information about CRAN packages.”\n\nSince our data sources themselves are packages, we think the repository will always be upto date thanks to github workflows!
